# LanguageSpeedTest
Made out of interest to test the speed of languages and their optimization

# Specifications PC
Itel Core I7 3770 3.4 GHz (Not boosted)

16 GB RAM (Speed: 2200)

Disk: HDD Baracuda 7700 rpm

# Results
> C#

Starting: 16.10.2020 19:10:46

CPU usage: 25,8%

Score result: 71523

Ending: 16.10.2020 19:10:58

> C++

Starting: 17.43

Ending: 17.52

PC CPU usage: 0.8

Score result: 23760

# Outcome
C # is faster, but less optimized. The advantage of C ++ is in optimization, although it is 2 times slower (please note, I only recently started to learn it, so my implementation may be storing it).
